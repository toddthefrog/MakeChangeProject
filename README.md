## Make Change Project

This project simulates a cash register.  A user is asked to enter an item amount.  The user then enters the amount.

The program will calculate the change returned by the largest denomination.  For example:



This is my week 1 [Skill Distillery](http://skilldistillery.com) weekend homework.

### How to use:
The program will prompt the user to enter the price of the item in this format "20.00" without quotes.

Once entered the program will ask the user how much they are giving the cashier which will be entered
in the same format "20.00" without quotes.

If the customer doesn't have enough money they will be shown how short they are.

If the customer has enough money their change will be displayed and below that a tally of how many bills and coins
the customer should receive.
